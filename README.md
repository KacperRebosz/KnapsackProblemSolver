# KnapsackProblemSolver
Project assignment for semester credit. Program uses genetic algorithm to solve knapsack problem.

Task description: 

Write a program that is designed to solve the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm. Program should take
input data from an input file that hols a set of items with their names, masses and values. Program should find a
subset of items with maximal value and total weight that does not exceed capacity of the knapsack provided by
user.
This program can be used from the command line by passing the following switches:
-i name.txt : input file with a set of items
-o name.txt : output file with the best solutions in all generations
-c value : knapsack capacity
-g value : number of generations
-n value : number of individuals in a generation
